@article{erwig:gencel:2006,
	abstract = {A huge discrepancy between theory and practice exists in one popular application area of functional programming -- spreadsheets. Although spreadsheets are the most frequently used (functional) programs, they fall short of the quality level that is expected of functional programs, which is evidenced by the fact that existing spreadsheets contain many errors, some of which have serious impacts. We have developed a template specification language that allows the definition of spreadsheet templates that describe possible spreadsheet evolutions. This language is based on a table calculus that formally captures the process of creating and modifying spreadsheets. We have developed a type system for this calculus that can prevent type, reference, and omission errors from occurring in spreadsheets. On the basis of the table calculus we have developed Gencel, a system for generating reliable spreadsheets. We have implemented a prototype version of Gencel as an extension of Excel. },

@inbook{ss-programming:2007,
	abstract = {Spreadsheets are among the most widely used programming systems in the world. Individuals and businesses use spreadsheets for a wide variety of applications, ranging from performing simple calculations to building complex financial models. In this article, we first discuss how spreadsheet programs are actually functional programs. We then describe concepts in spreadsheet programming, followed by a brief history of spreadsheet systems. Widespread use of spreadsheets, coupled with their high error-proneness and the impact of spreadsheet errors, has motivated research into techniques aimed at the prevention, detection, and correction of errors in spreadsheets. We present an overview of research effort that seeks to rectify this problem.},
